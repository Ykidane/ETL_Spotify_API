# ETL_Spotify_API(ongoing project...)
In this project I will explore how to extract data from Spotify API and parse the json data to make it more structured then the data will be put it in pandas dataframe, and finally the data will be stored in database. The purpose of this project is to explore end-to-end data pipline creation, which usually refered as ETL(Extract, Transform, Load).
